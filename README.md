# AdventOfCode2023

For solving Advent Of Code 2023 puzzles using python

There are a total of 50 puzzles, two puzzles each day for 25 days.
Each puzzle has it's own directory (i.e. `day01a` for day 1 puzzle a)
for the code (normally `puzzle01a.py` for example for day 1 puzzle a).
These directories have a subdirectory `data` for sample data, usually
`test.input` for the sample given with the puzzle and `my.input` as
the actual random input given for the competition.    

The puzzle program should look in the data directory for `.input` files
and produce corresponding `.output` files.

Common utilities can be found in `util.py` in the root directory, for example
functions to list the input files.
